-----how i plan to parallelise the program----
the sequential program calculates the resulting matrix one row at a time, pushing the rows to the matrix after each is built.
i plan on parallelising this by first creating a matrix of the required size, then dividing the number of rows
by the number of threads available. this way, each thread is responsible for calculating its own chunk of the resulting matrix.
the actual multiplication algorithm will remain largely unchanged for the time being...
